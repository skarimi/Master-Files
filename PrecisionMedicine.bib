abstract = {We can often detect from a person’s utterances whether he or she is in favor of or against a given target entity—one’s stance toward the target. However, a person may express the same stance toward a target by using negative or positive language. Here for the first time we present a dataset of tweet–target pairs annotated for both stance and sentiment. The targets may or may not be referred to in the tweets, and they may or may not be the target of opinion in the tweets. Partitions of this dataset were used as training and test sets in a SemEval-2016 shared task competition. We propose a simple stance detection system that outperforms submissions from all 19 teams that participated in the shared task. Additionally, access to both stance and sentiment annotations allows us to explore several research questions. We show that although knowing the sentiment expressed by a tweet is beneficial for stance classification, it alone is not sufficient. Finally, we use additional unlabeled data through distant supervision techniques and word embeddings to further improve stance classification.},

Given that data annotation is expensive and time-consuming, finding ways to leverage abundant unlabeled in-domain data can offer great benefits. In this paper, we apply a weakly supervised framework to enhance cross-target generalization through synthetically annotated data. We focus on Twitter SD and show experimentally that integrating synthetic data is helpful for cross-target generalization, leading to significant improvements in performance, with gains in F1 scores ranging from +3.4 to +5.1.",

Past work mentions errors in this prediction when symptom words, i.e., names of symptoms of interest, are used in a figurative sense. Therefore, we combine a state-of-the-art figurative usage detection with CNN-based personal health mention detection. To do so, we present two methods: a pipeline-based approach and a feature augmentation-based approach. The introduction of figurative usage detection results in an average improvement of 2.21{\%} F-score of personal health mention detection, in the case of the feature augmentation-based approach. This paper demonstrates the promise of using figurative usage detection to improve personal health mention detection.",

Processing biomedical and clinical text is a critically important application area of natural language processing, for which there are few robust, practical, publicly available models.

We detail the performance of two packages of models released in scispaCy and demonstrate their robustness on several tasks and datasets.

              their understanding of the risks and benefits for themselves and
              for society as a whole. DISCUSSION: There are rules in place to
              protect human research subjects and all studies involving humans
              are reviewed locally to ensure that subjects are treated safely,
              fairly, and confidentially. Nevertheless, each subject should
              consider for themselves whether participation is consistent with
              their values. CONCLUSION: Clinical trials, when well-designed,

  abstract = "The development of a patient-centered approach to medicine is
              gradually allowing more patients to be involved in their own
              medical decisions. However, this change is not happening at the
              same rate in clinical research, where research generally
              continues to be carried out on patients, but not with patients.
              This work describes the why, when, and how of more active patient
              participation in the research process. Specific measures are
              proposed to improve patient involvement in 1) setting priorities,
              2) study leadership and design, 3) improved access to clinical
              trials, 4) preparation and oversight of the information provided
              to participants, 5) post-study evaluation of the patient
              experience, and 6) the dissemination and application of results.
              In order to achieve these aims, the relative emphases on the
              ethical principles underlying research need to be changed. The
              current model based on the principle of beneficence must be left
              behind, and one that upholds the ethical principles of autonomy
              and non maleficence should be embraced. There is a need to
              improve the level of information that patients and society as a
              whole have on research objectives and processes; the goal is to
              promote the gradual emergence of the expert patient.",

    abstract = { Purpose Studies have shown an association between socioeconomic status (SES) and quality of oncology care, but less is known about the impact of patient SES on clinical trial participation. Patients and Methods We assessed clinical trial participation patterns according to important SES (income, education) and demographic factors in a large sample of patients surveyed via an Internet-based treatment decision tool. Logistic regression, conditioning on type of cancer, was used. Attitudes toward clinical trials were assessed using prespecified items about treatment, treatment tolerability, convenience, and cost. Results From 2007 to 2011, 5,499 patients were successfully surveyed. Forty percent discussed clinical trials with their physician, 45\% of discussions led to physician offers of clinical trial participation, and 51\% of offers led to clinical trial participation. The overall clinical trial participation rate was 9\%. In univariate models, older patients (P = .002) and patients with lower income (P = .001) and education (P = .02) were less likely to participate in clinical trials. In a multivariable model, income remained a statistically significant predictor of clinical trial participation (odds ratio, 0.73; 95\% CI, 0.57 to 0.94; P = .01). Even in patients age ≥ 65 years, who have universal access to Medicare, lower income predicted lower trial participation. Cost concerns were much more evident among lower-income patients (P < .001). Conclusion Lower-income patients were less likely to participate in clinical trials, even when considering age group. A better understanding of why income is a barrier may help identify ways to make clinical trials better available to all patients and would increase the generalizability of clinical trial results across all income levels. }

              major search engines was undertaken. We identified studies from
              January 1, 2000, to January 1, 2020, that examined clinical trial
              participation in the United States. Studies must have specified
              the numbers of patients offered a trial and the number enrolled.
              A random effects model of proportions was used. All statistical
              tests were 2-sided. RESULTS: We identified 35 studies (30 about
              treatment trials and 5 about cancer control trials) among which
              9759 patients were offered trial participation. Overall, 55.0\%
              (95\% confidence interval [CI] = 49.4\% to 60.5\%) of patients
              agreed to enroll. Participation rates did not differ between
              treatment (55.0\%, 95\% CI = 48.9\% to 60.9\%) and cancer control
              trials (55.3\%, 95\% CI = 38.9\% to 71.1\%; P = .98). Black
              patients participated at similar rates (58.4\%, 95\% CI = 46.8\%
              to 69.7\%) compared with White patients (55.1\%, 95\% CI = 44.3\%
              to 65.6\%; P = .88). The main reasons for nonparticipation were
              treatment choice or lack of interest. CONCLUSIONS: More than half
              of all cancer patients offered a clinical trial do participate.
              These findings upend several conventional beliefs about cancer
              clinical trial participation, including that Black patients are
              less likely to agree to participate and that patient
              decision-making is the primary barrier to participation. Policies
              and interventions to improve clinical trial participation should
              focus more on modifiable systemic structural and clinical
              barriers, such as improving access to available trials and
              broadening eligibility criteria.",

We report large improvements over previous results on a standard benchmark test collection, showing that fine-tuning pretrained BERT with SQuAD is sufficient to achieve high accuracy in identifying answer spans.",

In this work, we propose a novel neural IR model named PACRR aiming at better modeling position-dependent interactions between a query and a document.

However, dense retrievers are hard to train, typically requiring heavily engineered fine-tuning pipelines to realize their full potential. In this paper, we identify and address two underlying problems of dense retrievers: i) fragility to training data noise and ii) requiring large batches to robustly learn the embedding space. We use the recently proposed Condenser pre-training architecture, which learns to condense information into the dense vector through LM pre-training. On top of it, we propose coCondenser, which adds an unsupervised corpus-level contrastive loss to warm up the passage embedding space. Experiments on MS-MARCO, Natural Question, and Trivia QA datasets show that coCondenser removes the need for heavy data engineering such as augmentation, synthesis, or filtering, and the need for large batch training. It shows comparable performance to RocketQA, a state-of-the-art, heavily engineered system, using simple small batch fine-tuning.",

    abstract = "Human ability to understand language is \textit{general, flexible, and robust}. In contrast, most NLU models above the word level are designed for a specific task and struggle with out-of-domain data. If we aspire to develop models with understanding beyond the detection of superficial correspondences between inputs and outputs, then it is critical to develop a unified model that can execute a range of linguistic tasks across different domains. To facilitate research in this direction, we present the General Language Understanding Evaluation (GLUE, gluebenchmark.com): a benchmark of nine diverse NLU tasks, an auxiliary dataset for probing models for understanding of specific linguistic phenomena, and an online platform for evaluating and comparing models. For some benchmark tasks, training data is plentiful, but for others it is limited or does not match the genre of the test set. GLUE thus favors models that can represent linguistic knowledge in a way that facilitates sample-efficient learning and effective knowledge-transfer across tasks. While none of the datasets in GLUE were created from scratch for the benchmark, four of them feature privately-held test data, which is used to ensure that the benchmark is used fairly. We evaluate baselines that use ELMo (Peters et al., 2018), a powerful transfer learning technique, as well as state-of-the-art sentence representation models. The best models still achieve fairly low absolute scores. Analysis with our diagnostic dataset yields similarly weak performance over all phenomena tested, with some exceptions.",
